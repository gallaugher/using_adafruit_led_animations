Sample code created in Prof. Gallaugher's "Using the adafruit led animations library (CircuitPython School)"

Note that this code is designed to work on a CircuitPlayground Express or BlueFruit board
- using a NeoPixel light strip 30 lights
- attached to pad A1

However the code can be easily modified to work with other CircuitPython boards, and NeoPixel strips or strands of different length. When using on non-CircuitPlayground boards, just be sure to comment out the setup of the neopixels on the board - that'd be every line that refers to the "pixels" object.
